# Spotify-Playlist-Creator

 With this procjet, you are able to scrape a page for a Tracklist, search these tracks in Spotify and add the tracks to a playlist that already exists.

At the moment, this only works with the playlist of BBC Radio 1's Drum & Bass Show.
But it should be relativly easy to do this for any other website, since the method for searching and adding the found songs to a playlist, simply needs a dictonary with key = artist and value = song-name.
